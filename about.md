Hi there!

My name is Alex.

I am a software engineer *in training*.

I have a B. Sc.
in Psychology. My honours thesis was "An fMRI investigation of working memory in chemotherapy-treated breast cancer patients".
I have also taken numerous 2nd and 3rd year Chemistry classes while I was debating
my transfer into a software engineering field.

However, once I transfered into software engineering, I have not looked back.

My current interests are in the area of web development.
I like the idea of using a tool regardless of the device and operating
system. I believe that the user experience for your tool should be
identical on all platforms and devices.

I also like information security and I follow the topics of security primarily via
twitter and [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com).

I also like knowledge for its own sake.
I have successfully taken courses at uOttawa in various disciplines ranging from
Philosophy, Social Sciences, Business Management, Economics, Science,
Mathematics, and Engineering just to name a few.
